# docker-kanka-ce

## THIS IS A FORK OF https://github.com/Kanka-CE/docker-kanka-ce AND NOT FOR PRODUCTIVE

The Dockerfile used to build the Kanka Community Edition container image, styled after [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io)'s image conventions.

> **Want to self-host Kanka CE?** You don't need this repo directly — go to
> **[kanka-ce-deploy](https://github.com/Kanka-CE/kanka-ce-deploy)**, which has the docker-compose file and
> full Quick Start guide, and references the image this repo builds.

## What is this?

This repo contains *only* the image build recipe: the `Dockerfile` and supporting `root/` filesystem for the s6-overlay. 
It doesn't contain Kanka's source code or any patches;
those are located at [kanka-community-edition](https://github.com/Kanka-CE/kanka-community-edition) and [kanka-ce-deploy](https://github.com/Kanka-CE/kanka-ce-deploy), respectively.

By default, the image is built from the latest (already patched) release of `kanka-community-edition`. 
The resulting container is published to the container registry that `kanka-ce-deploy`'s compose file
points at.

## Building the image yourself

```
git clone https://github.com/Kanka-CE/docker-kanka-ce.git
cd docker-kanka-ce
docker build -t kanka-ce:local .
```
